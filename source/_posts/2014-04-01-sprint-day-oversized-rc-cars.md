The club held its first sprint day on Saturday. The sprint was held for the oversized RC car project, but also to test out the sprint day format as a possible standard format for club projects.<figure id="attachment_60" style="width: 1000px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

The aims of the day were to complete major aspects of the project: Android bluetooth communication code, Arduino bluetooth communication code, Arduino hardware interfacing, Relay replacement with MOSFETs, MOSFET H-bridge design

*   Android bluetooth communication code
*   Arduino bluetooth communication code
*   Arduino hardware interfacing
*   Relay replacement with MOSFETs
*   MOSFET H-bridge design, including PCB design (ready for milling)<figure id="attachment_62" style="width: 1000px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

In addition to the H-bridge circuitry, logic was implemented to ensure shorting 12V to GND was impossible. This also was able to reduce the required input pins to 2.<figure id="attachment_66" style="width: 1000px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Due to the higher current, it was decided to prototype the H-bridge using a terminal block. However, this monster ended up taking a lot of time and was very messy. I would recommend a better solution for future reference. Unfortunately, the MOSFET H-bridge design was not complete by the end of the day. We ran out of time for the troubleshooting, though we still managed to find time for lunch and a few beers duringÂ the day.
