Hello and welcome. This page is where I intend to keep a log of my projects and progress. The projects that will be covered here will involve the topics of programming, robotics and signal processing.

This pageÂ is as much for myself to keep track as it is for others to gain inspiration or to learn from my mistakes. Feel free to ask any questions about the projects.
