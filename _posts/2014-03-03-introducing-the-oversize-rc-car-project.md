The [Robo Club][1] has agreed to take on this project this semester, and I will be leading the project. In fact I have already done some work on the project leading up to the beginning of the semester, having designed a relay board for use with an Arduino Pro Mini 5V.

I used NPN transistor buffers from the output of the Arduino to drive the transistor coils. I did this because I don&#8217;t like the idea of the board driving the coil directly (although it should be possible). I feel safer having the inductive coil somewhat isolated from the circuit by the transistor.<figure id="attachment_53" style="width: 1000px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

The relays used here are M4-5H, which are only rated to 0.5A. However, the motors can pull up to 3A stall current. Therefore, the relays aren&#8217;t expected to last. They do the job, however: for now..

This temporary solution is designed to allow the car to be shown off in order to raise interest fromÂ Robo Club members to participate in the project.
