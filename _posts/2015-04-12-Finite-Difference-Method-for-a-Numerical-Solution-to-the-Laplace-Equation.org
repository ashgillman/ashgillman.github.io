* Aim
To develop a numerical solution using to the the voltage and
electrical field in a two-dimensional cross section of a coaxial cable
of a given shape.

* Theory
A numerical solution to a problem works by solving the problem over a
series of discrete points rather than solving over the entire
continuous domain. For a two-dimensional problem, this generally means
solving over a grid. The grid must contain within it the entire
problem domain, in this practical this means that the coaxial cable
cross-section must be fully contained within the grid.

Additionally, the numerical solution is calculated iteratively. This
means that a new estimate is made for each point based on the current
estimates, and this is continuously updated. If the estimation method
is accurate, the points will eventually converge towards the correct
solution.

Voltage can be related to electric field, $\textbf{E}$, in two
dimensions by the following formulae:

#+NAME: eq:V_E
\begin{align}
  \mathbf{E} &= -\nabla V \label{eq:V_E} \\
  \mathbf{E} &= -\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}V\mathbf{\hat{x}} - \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}V\mathbf{\hat{y}} \label{eq:V_E_cart}
\end{align}

Combining \eqref{eq:V_E} with the property of the electric field that its
divergence isÂ 0, $\nabla\cdot\mathbf{E}=0$
\cite{griffiths1999introduction}, yields Laplace's equation:

$$\nabla^2V=0$$

where $\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian operator \cite{weisstein}. Laplace's
equation is a partial differential equation, and can also be given for
two dimensions in Cartesian form as:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial y^2}=0
            \label{eq:Laplace}
\end{equation}

Finding a solution to Laplace's equation required knowledge of the
boundary conditions, and as such it is referred to as a boundary value
problem (BVP). BVPs can be solved numerically using a method known as
the finide difference (FD) method \cite{hoffman2001numerical,kosov}.

** Finite Difference Method
In the FD method, differential equations are replace by their FD
approximation. This approximation can be derived using the Taylor's
theorem \cite{hoffman2001numerical}, given by:
\begin{equation}
f(z)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{f^{(k)}(z_0)}{k!}(z-z_0)^k
        \label{eq:TS}
\end{equation}
where $f$ is a function we are trying to solve
for at point $z$, given a known value $f(z_0)$, and $f^{(k)}$ is the
$k^{\text{th}}$ derivative of $f$ \cite{zill2011advanced}. A
suitable grid for calculation of a coaxial cable cross-section is given
in figure [[fig:numerical_scheme]] /Left}/, and in figure [[fig:numerical_scheme]]
/Right}/ is a close-up of the computational grid, used for approximation
of $\frac{\partial^n V}{\partial x^n}$ and
$\frac{\partial^n V}{\partial y^n}$.

We will first consider a FD method for approximating the first
derivative, followed by a method for the second
derivative. Approximation by Taylor series (TS), as given in
\eqref{eq:TS}, can be achieved by truncating the infinite
sum. Truncating to three terms gives:
\begin{align}
        f(z) &= f(z_0) + f'(z_0)(z-z_0) + \frac{f''(z_0)}{2}(z-z_0)^2 + O((z-z_0)^3) \notag\\
        f(z) &\approx f(z_0) + f'(z_0)(z-z_0) + \frac{f''(z_0)}{2}(z-z_0)^2         \label{eq:TS_approx}
\end{align}

If we consider $z_0$ in \eqref{eq:TS_approx} to be a point on a
one-dimensional computational grid, $z_i$, and $z$ to be the point to
the left of $z_i$, $z_{i-1}=z_i-d_x$, this becomes:
\begin{equation}
f(z_{i-1}) \approx f(z_i) - f'(z_i)(d_x) + \frac{f''(z_i)}{2}d_x^2
        \label{eq:TS_approx_l}
\end{equation}
Similarly, if $z_0=z_i$, and $z$ is the
point to the right of $z_i$, $z_{i+1}=z_i+d_x$, this becomes:
\begin{equation}
f(z_{i+1}) \approx f(z_i) + f'(z_i)(d_x) + \frac{f''(z_i)}{2}d_x^2
        \label{eq:TS_approx_r}
\end{equation}

Subtracting, \eqref{eq:TS_approx_r} $-$ \eqref{eq:TS_approx_l} gives:
$$f'(z_i) \approx \frac{f(z_{i+1}) - f(z_{i-1})}{2d_x}$$ which is known
as the central difference approximation to the derivative
\cite{hoffman2001numerical}. Equations \eqref{eq:TS_approx_r} and
\eqref{eq:TS_approx_l} can also be used to generate a second order
derivative approximation. Summing, \eqref{eq:TS_approx_l} $+$
\eqref{eq:TS_approx_r} gives \cite{hoffman2001numerical}:
$$f''(z_i) \approx \frac{f(z_{i-1}) - 2f(z_i) + f(z_{i+1})}{d_x^2}$$
Finally, a trivial extension into two dimensions yields:
\begin{align}
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}     &\approx
    \frac{f(z_{i+1,j}) - f(z_{i-1,j})}{2d_x} \label{eq:1stO_FD_x} \\
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}     &\approx
    \frac{f(z_{i,j+1}) - f(z_{i,j-1})}{2d_y} \label{eq:1stO_FD_y} \\
  \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} &\approx
    \frac{f(z_{i-1,j}) - 2f(z_{i,j}) + f(z_{i+1,j})}{d_x^2} \label{eq:2ndO_FD_x} \\
  \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2} &\approx
    \frac{f(z_{i,j-1}) - 2f(z_{i,j}) + f(z_{i,j+1})}{d_y^2} \label{eq:2ndO_FD_y}
\end{align}

The error associated with
\eqref{eq:1stO_FD_x}, \eqref{eq:1stO_FD_y}, \eqref{eq:2ndO_FD_x}, and
\eqref{eq:2ndO_FD_y} is $O(\frac{d^3}{d})=O(d^2)$.

** Solving Laplace's Equation for Voltage and Electric Field
Substituting \eqref{eq:2ndO_FD_x} and \eqref{eq:2ndO_FD_y} into
\eqref{eq:Laplace} gives the discretised from of Laplace's equation:

$$\frac{V(z_{i-1,j}) - 2V(z_{i,j}) + V(z_{i+1,j})}{d_x^2} + \frac{V(z_{i,j-1}) - 2V(z_{i,j}) + V(z_{i,j+1})}{d_y^2} \approx 0 \notag\\$$

\begin{equation}
V(z_{i,j}) \approx \frac{d_x^2(V(z_{i,j-1}) + V(z_{i,j+1})) + d_y^2 (V(z_{i-1,j}) + V(z_{i+1,j}))}{2(d_x^2 + d_y^2)}
        \label{eq:laplace_FD}
\end{equation}

If $d_x=d_y$, this becomes \cite{kosov}:
$$V(z_{i,j}) \approx \frac{V(z_{i,j+1}) + V(z_{i-1,j}) + V(z_{i+1,j}) + V(z_{i,j-1})}{4}$$
which satisfies the condition of a solution to Laplace's equation that a
point at the centre of an n-sphere should be the mean of its edges
\cite{weisstein}. However, the form given in \eqref{eq:laplace_FD} will be
used in this simulation to allow for independent $x$ and $y$ grid
spacings.

Finite differences can also be used to calculate the electric field from
the voltage. Substituting \eqref{eq:1stO_FD_x} and \eqref{eq:1stO_FD_y} into
\eqref{eq:V_E_cart} gives:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{E} \approx -\frac{V(z_{i+1,j}) - V(z_{i-1,j})}{2d_x}\mathbf{\hat{x}} - \frac{V(z_{i,j+1}) - V(z_{i,j-1})}{2d_y}\mathbf{\hat{y}}
        \label{eq:E_V_FD}
\end{equation}

* Methodology

1. Using equations \eqref{eq:laplace_FD} and \eqref{eq:E_V_FD}, the
   MATLAB code give in the appendix was developed. The following
   describes each code block:

   a) =% Input Parameters=
      - =shieldxs [...]=: Shield polygon x coordinates.
      - =shieldys [...]=: Shield polygon y coordinates.
      - =shieldv=: Shield voltage.
      - =corexs [...]=: Core polygon x coordinates.
      - =coreys [...]=: Core polygon y coordinates.
      - =corev=: Core voltage.
      - =gridsize [x,y]=: No. x and y grid points.
      - =maxits=: Maximum no. of iterations to perform.
      - =err=: Maximum allowable error before convergence.

   b) =% Field (real units)=

      The field is initialised to cover the coaxial cable cross section.

   c) =% Grid (pixels)=

      A computational grid is defined over the field.

   d) =% Set grid initial value=

      Initialise outer shield voltages to shieldv, inner core voltages
      to corev, and space voltages to
      $\frac{1}{2}(\texttt{shieldv}+\texttt{corev})$

   e) =% iterations=

      Iterate [eq:laplace_{F}D] for all points except edge points, reset
      core and shield voltages to initial values, and check for
      convergence.

   f) =% Calculate E=

      Using \eqref{eq:E_V_FD}, calculate the electric field. Also,
      ensure that the field inside the conductors is 0, preventing
      slight errors creeping in at the edges.

   g) =% Plot V and E=

      Plot the resultant voltage and electric fields.

2. The above simulation was run for a number of different cases. In
   each, the outer shield was an equilateral triangle with sides of 10
   cm, and the core was a square with sides of 2 cm, gridsize was
   $129\times129$, maxits was 10,000 and err was 0.01. Other test
   parameters used are given in table [[tbl:test_params]].

   #+NAME: tbl:test_params
   #+CAPTION: Test Parameters
   | Test no.   | shieldv   | corev   |
   |------------+-----------+---------|
   | 1          | 0 V       | 20 V    |
   | 2          | 20 V      | 0 V     |
   | 3          | -10 V     | 10 V    |
   | 4          | 10 V      | -10 V   |

3. In addition, the simulation was run using test conditions from test
   no. 1 for a range of grid sizes, $[2^n+1, 2^n+1]$ for
   $n=3, 4, ..., 10$. Increasing the grid size allowed for smaller $d_x$
   and $d_y$ values to be investigated, and their associated error.

* Discussion

The simulations appeared to be accurate and results were logical and
consistent with known properties of the voltage and electric field.

Voltage was constant within the conductors, both the shield and core, in
tables [[fig:res_1]], [[fig:res_2]], [[fig:res_3]], and [[fig:res_4]] /left)/ (although this
was expected, as it was strictly enforced within the code).
Additionally, there were no voltage minima or maxima within the space
between, the minima and maxima occurred only at the conductors. These
are both qualitatively verifiable properties of a voltage field that
were expected \cite{griffiths1999introduction} and observed, supporting
the accuracy of the simulation.

The electric field in tables [[fig:res_1]], [[fig:res_2]], [[fig:res_3]], and [[fig:res_4]]
/right)/ similarly demonstrated the expected properties. The field
formed a smooth vector field, with no noticeable curl. The electric
field also pointed from positive voltage to negative voltage, as
expected. Finally, vectors intersected conductor surfaces at
approximately 90. These properties were again expected
\cite{griffiths1999introduction}, and supported confidence in the
accuracy of the simulation.

Interestingly noted was that tables [[fig:res_1]] and [[fig:res_3]] were identical,
with the exception of the colour scales in tables [[fig:res_1]] and [[fig:res_3]]
/left)/, as were tables [[fig:res_2]] and [[fig:res_4]]. This phenomena is due to the
voltage field being described by linear differential equations. Thus
linearly translated boundary conditions yield correspondingly linearly
scaled solutions. The electric field, however, is related by the
derivative of the voltage field. Therefore, constant translations have
no effect on the electric field, as demonstrated in tables
[[fig:res_1]] and [[fig:res_3]] /right)/, and tables [[fig:res_2]] and [[fig:res_4]]
/right)/. For the same reasons, the voltage fields in tables
[[fig:res_1]] and [[fig:res_3]] /left)/ were opposite to those in tables
[[fig:res_2]] and [[fig:res_4]] /left)/, and the electric fields in tables
[[fig:res_1]] and [[fig:res_3]] /right)/ were equal in magnitude (see the
contour lines) and opposite in direction to those in tables
[[fig:res_2]] and [[fig:res_4]] /right)/. The boundary conditions between
these two pairs were simply reversed.

Finally, table [[fig:v_convergence]] shows the calculated voltage for a given
$d_x$. Here it was noted that the variation between Voltage estimates
was considerably lower for low values of $d_x$ and increased with $d_x$.
This result was consistent with the theory outlined in equations
\eqref{eq:1stO_FD_x}, \eqref{eq:1stO_FD_y}, \eqref{eq:2ndO_FD_x}, and
\eqref{eq:2ndO_FD_y}, stating the associated error was in the order of
the square of $d_x$.

* Conclusion

A numerical solution to the voltage and electrical field in a
two-dimensional cross section of a coaxial cable, where the outer shield
was an equilateral triangle with sides of 10 cm, and the core was a
square with sides of 2 cm, was developed using methods. The accuracy of
this method was verified using empirical means, based on qualitative
observations of the resultant fields. These results indicated confidence
in the accuracy of the method. Additional properties of the linearity of
the electrical and voltage fields were noted, specifically the
invariance of the electric field under boundary voltage translation,
given the difference was the same.
