* Aim
To analyse a two-dimensional vertical section of Earth and analyse the
pore water content using dipole-dipole resistivity measurements.

* Theory
Consider an infinite and homogeneous Earth of resistivity $\rho$. Let
the voltage at infinity be $U_\infty=0$, and let us apply a voltage at
the origin as in figure [[fig:equipotential_1]]. Ohm's law states $V=IR$,
where $V$ is the potential drop through the soil. In terms of the
resistivity, this means: $$V=I\frac{\rho l}{A}$$ where $l$ is the
distance from the voltage applied, and $A$ is the surface area current
travels through at distance $l$. Note that here $l=r$, the radial
distance from the origin. This equation shows that the drop in voltage
depends on the distance travelled through the Earth, i.e. equipotential
surfaces will all be equidistant from the origin. Noting that $A$ forms
a hemisphere gives $A=\frac{1}{2}4\pi r^2$, so:
\begin{equation}
V(\mathbf{r})=I\frac{\rho}{2\pi r} \label{eq:V_from_node}
\end{equation}

Extending this idea to incorporate two applied voltages can be
accomplished through superposition. Figure [[fig:equipotential_2]] shows the equipotential
surfaces and currents caused by two equal and opposite applied voltages.
The corresponding extension to \eqref{eq:V_from_node} for two
sources is:
\begin{align}
V(\mathbf{r})&=I\frac{\rho}{2\pi\left|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r_a}\right|}-I\frac{\rho}{2\pi\left|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r_b}\right|} \notag\\
V(\mathbf{r})&=I\frac{\rho}{2\pi}\left[\frac{1}{\left|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r_a}\right|}-\frac{1}{\left|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r_b}\right|}\right] \label{eq:V_from_dipole}
\end{align}

However, since $V_\infty$ cannot be measured in a practical test, two
separate voltage measurements must be made and the difference used in
order to gain meaningful results. Such a measurement can be made with
the experimental setup shown in figure [[fig:wenner]]. Using
\eqref{eq:V_from_dipole} and assuming that current is injected from node
$A$ to node $B$, the voltage between nodes $M$ and $N$ is given by:
\begin{align}
V_{MN}=V(M)-V(N)&=I\frac{\rho}{2\pi}\left[\frac{1}{\left|\mathbf{r_m}-\mathbf{r_a}\right|}-\frac{1}{\left|\mathbf{r_m}-\mathbf{r_b}\right|}-\frac{1}{\left|\mathbf{r_n}-\mathbf{r_a}\right|}+\frac{1}{\left|\mathbf{r_n}-\mathbf{r_b}\right|}\right] \label{eq:geom_K}\\
&=I\frac{\rho}{2\pi}\frac{1}{K} \label{eq:V_homo}
\end{align}
where $K$ is known as the geometric factor, dependent on the electrode
setup.

Where the Earth in no longer homogeneous, $\rho$ may be constantly
varying, thus a given electrode setup can only measure a weighted
indication of the local resistivity. Therefore, once a heterogeneous
Earth is considered, we refer to the measured resistivity as the
apparent resistivity, $\rho_a$ \cite{wightman2004application}.
Rearranging \eqref{eq:V_homo}
\begin{equation}
\rho_a=2\pi K \frac{V}{I} \label{eq:apparent_resistivity}
\end{equation}

A dipole-dipole array uses separated dipoles for each pair, the
current injectors and the voltage measuring. This setup is depicted in
figures [[fig:dipole_1]] and [[fig:dipole_2]]. Let the left and right current
nodes be nodes $b$ and $a$ respectively, and the left and right
voltage nodes be $m$ and $n$ respectively. It can be seen that:

\begin{align}
\left|\mathbf{r_m}-\mathbf{r_b}\right|&=(n+1)\alpha, & \left|\mathbf{r_n}-\mathbf{r_b}\right|&=(n+2)\alpha, \\ \left|\mathbf{r_m}-\mathbf{r_a}\right|&=n\alpha, & \left|\mathbf{r_n}-\mathbf{r_a}\right|&=(n+1)\alpha
\end{align}

Using the geometric factor definition from \eqref{eq:geom_K}, the geometric
factor is given by:
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{K}&=\left[\frac{1}{n\alpha}-\frac{1}{(n+1)\alpha}-\frac{1}{(n+1)\alpha}+\frac{1}{(n+2)\alpha}\right] \notag\\
\frac{1}{K}&=\left[\frac{1}{n\alpha}-\frac{2}{(n+1)\alpha}+\frac{1}{(n+2)\alpha}\right] \notag\\
\frac{1}{K}&=\frac{(n+1)(n+2)\alpha^2 - 2n(n+2)\alpha^2 + n(n+1)\alpha^2}{n(n+1)(n+2)\alpha^3} \notag\\
\frac{1}{K}&=\frac{1}{\alpha}\frac{2}{n(n+1)(n+2)} \notag\\
K&=\frac{1}{2}\alpha n(n+1)(n+2) \label{eq:K}
\end{align}
Combining \eqref{eq:apparent_resistivity} and \eqref{eq:K} gives the
following \cite{wightman2004application}:
\begin{equation}
\rho_a=\pi\alpha
n(n+1)(n+2)\frac{V}{I} \label{eq:dipole}
\end{equation}

Figure [[fig:dipole_depth]] demonstrates how using \eqref{eq:dipole}, and
varying $n$ allows a two-dimensional depth-resistivity profile to be
produced. Since most soils have a relatively high resistivity, with
the exception of metal ore deposits, most of the resistivity actually
measured is due to the pore water content of the soil
\cite{wightman2004application}.

* Materials
-  the MiniSting^{TM} earth resistivity meter
-  the Swift^{TM} automatic electrode system
-  associated cabling
-  a 12 V DC battery
-  two 12 node electrode cables
-  28 electrode stakes
-  28 alligator clips
-  approximately 50 L of salted water
-  a sledge hammer
-  a laptop PC
-  a GPS device (mobile phone)

* Methodology
1.  The electrode stakes were spaced at 2.5 m intervals along a
    straight line, the intended measurement region, and were driven
    each 10 to 20 cm deep. Salt water was poured over each stake to
    ensure a good electrical connection with the earth.

2.  The two electrode cables were laid out end-to-end, alongside the
    electrodes. Each electrode stake was connected to the cable
    electrode using the alligator clips.

3.  A GPS device was used to measure the coordinates at the start,
    join, and end of the two electrode cables.

4.  The MiniSting, Swift, switch box, battery and electrode cabling
    were connected as depicted in [[fig:setup]].

5.  The MiniSting^{TM} was configured with the parameters outlined in
    [[tbl:ministing_params]].

    #+NAME: tbl:ministing_params
    #+CAPTION: MiniSting^{TM} Parameters
    | Parameter          | Setting   |
    |--------------------+-----------|
    | Current            | 100 mA    |
    | Max. Cycles        | 2         |
    | Accuracy           | 5%        |
    | Measurement Time   | 1.2 s     |
    | Voltage            | 200 V     |

6.  A contact resistance test was run to ensure that an adequately low
    contact resistance was achieved.

7.  The MiniSting^{TM} automatic dipole-dipole profile test was
    initiated.

8.  After measurement number 217, the current was increased to 150 mA
    as some measurements were failing and being recalculated, slowing
    the measurement process.

9.  After completion of the test, the results were uploaded to the PC
    and analysed with the AGI EarthImager 2D Inversion software
    \cite{earthimager}.

10. A second group also repeated a similar process, with a 3 m spacing.
    These results, labelled group 2, were also included for analysis.

* Results

Following are the results from group 1. Table [[tbl:gps]] shows the GPS

*** Observations
-  Whilst inserting the electrodes that the more southern electrodes
   were more difficult to insert due to dryer and rockier ground.
-  Measurements were made in May, as Townsville is coming out of the
   wet season. Last rainfall was in the order of weeks before.

** Group 2
Following are the results from group 2, taken separately and for
comparison. Table [[tbl:gps_2]] shows the GPS location measured along the
cable. The measured results are shown in [[fig:2-res]].

It was also noted by a supervisor of both groups that both groups laid
node 1 as the south-most node, and that group 1's node 28 and group
2's node 24 were located at approximately the same location.

* Analysis
Each group's GPS coordinates were plotted in order to compare the
physical locations measured in each session. The results are shown in
figure [[fig:GPS]]. However, the locations for group 1 were seen to be
inaccurate, showing a location approximately 1 km north of the actual
location. Therefore, sketched information from figure [[fig:sketch]] was
used for the group 1 location. An updated map is given in figure
[[fig:GPS_est]].

The information in figures [[fig:1-res]] and [[fig:2-res]] both agreed with
one-another and agreed with observations made at the site. It should
be noted that the left side of the plots corresponded to the
southern-most measurements. Both plots indicated a high surface
resistance on the southern end of the line. Additionally, results in
figure [[fig:1-res]] /Bottom)/ displayed a longer section of high surface
resistance compared with those in figure [[fig:1-res]] /Bottom)/. This was
consistent with the fact that group 1's cable ran further south. This
was also consistent with observations that the more southern stakes
were harder to insert. Harder and rockier soil is generally drier and
less conductive, as it holds less pore water.

Both figures [[fig:1-res]] and [[fig:2-res]] showed two areas of lower
resistivity at a depth of approximately 8--10 m. These sections also
appeared to line up between the two results. This is better
demonstrated in figure [[fig:res_aligned]], where the results were scaled
such that the group 1 size to group 2 size ratio was
2.5:3. Additionally, the two have been positioned such that group 1
node 28 aligns with group 2 node 24, as noted by the practical
supervisor.

Results in figure [[fig:res_aligned]] supported one another, indicating
accuracy in the measurements. Many of the common features physically
aligned between the two images in figure [[fig:res_aligned]], including:
-  three regions of lower resistivity at approximately 8--10 m depth,
   although the south-most region was more apparent in group 1's
   results;
-  a region of higher resistivity between the first two lower
   resistivity regions, which was again more apparent in group 1's
   results; and
-  A shallow, high resistivity region along the southern surface.

Examination of figures [[fig:res_aligned]] and [[fig:GPS_est]] indicated that
the latter mentioned region of high surface resistivity corresponded
to an area with little tree coverage. Areas with fauna coverage
however indicated a relatively high surface resistance. This was
likely no coincidence, instead indicating that the lack of tree
coverage had allowed the Sun to dry the surface in this area.

Figures [[fig:res_aligned]] and [[fig:GPS_est]] also showed that the two
dominant regions of lower resistivity lied near the mound to the west
of the measurements. It is possible that pore water in the mound
remaining from the wet season had seeped down, leaving the measured
region wetter than it would have otherwise been.  This was also the
region with the most tree coverage, which likely aided in pore water
retention.

Continued examination of [[fig:res_aligned]] showed the southern surface
region of group 1's results displayed an odd pattern not seen in group
2's results, where underneath node 2 there was a low resistivity
region.  It is possible that this was indicative of a bad
measurement. This may have also affected deeper regions, since an
iterative estimation is used to correct for heterogeneities in the
soil. This was supported by the two exaggerated regions of very high
and very low resistivity measured deeper below this area in group 1
results. Therefore it is likely that the southern measurements of
group 2 were more accurate than the southern measurements of group 1,
and that these regions were not in actuality so exaggerated. It is
possible these inconsistencies in group 1's measurements were due to
the change in current from 100 mA to 150 mA halfway through the test.

* Conclusion
The aim of the practical, to analyse a two-dimensional vertical
section of Earth and analyse the pore water content using
dipole-dipole resistivity measurements, was achieved. The results
indicated a high surface resistivity over exposed areas of earth, and
a relatively lower surface resistivity over regions shaded by
trees. The analysis also showed evidence of pore water at a depth of
approximately 8--10 m to the east of a nearby mound. It was determined
to be likely this pore water seeped from the mound from the wet
season, and was preserved by the shade of surrounding fauna.

An interesting additional conclusion was errors in the southern
measurements of group 1's results, which propagated to show
inconsistencies along the entire southern region. These errors were
attributed to a change in supplied current halfway through the test.
