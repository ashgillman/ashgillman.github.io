This recipe represents my first real attempt at a parti-gyle, two different beers from one mash.
I've done something a little similar before - using the second runnings to form a table beer.
But this is my first genuine attempt at two completely different beers.

The base recipe is a Marzen, but using Oceanic ingredients.
The second beer also uses oceanic ingredients, and will have steeped dark grains and some additional dark sugars to create a completely different beer.
I'm hoping to get something along the lines of Cooper Best Extra Stout.

I know I typically get about 70% efficiency when I batch sparge. So, I've just set up two different recipes with efficiencies that sum to 70%. I expect to overshoot on the first runnings, but I'll blend those with the second runnings to get my desired pre-boil gravity before I add any dark grains to the MLT.

# The recipe
Brewer's Friend Links: [Mates-en](https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/recipe/view/999371/mates-en)
and [No Stout About It](https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/recipe/view/999372/no-stout-about-it).

This will be my first beer in a while with no water adjustments, just the relatively soft Townsville water profile.
No sparge acidification, since I figured my roasted grains in the sparge will pull the pH down.

Mash:
- Gladfield Pisner base *(good quality simple malt)*
- 20% Gladfield Munich *(I think this is typical for style)*
- 5% Aurora (melanodin) *(in hopes to simulate a decoction mash)*
- 3% Sour Grapes *(for mash pH)*

Late additions for No Stout About It:
- 200 g Gladfield dark chocolate (steeped)
- 200 g Joe White roasted barley (steeped) *(not sure what I'm doing here)*
- 300 g molasses (into FV) *(bump up the OG. Should have been end of boil, but I forgot)*

Mash profile from [Continental Pilsener of the Classic Beer Style Series by David Miller](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1160686.Continental_Pilsener).
- 15 mins @ 55 C (Peptidase/Proteinase and a little Phytase/Beta-Glucanase)
- 60 mins (or until conversion) @ 65 C (Beta-amylase Saccharification)
- 5 mins @ 75 C (Mash out)

I used a thin mash at 3.6 L/kg, so that I got my full pre-boil gravity after draining.

During the mash, I steeped the dark grains -- I wanted a long steep to make sure I still extracted the roastiness, not just colour. I then blended BK/MLT until I had my pre-boil for the Mates-en.

Mates-en Boil:
- 18 IBUs Dr. Rudi First Wort (60 min boil) *(higher-AA sub for Hallertauer)*
- 15 g in 20 L Pacifica @ 10 mins *(sub for Hallertauer)*
- The usual 1/2 tablet whirlfloc and 1/2 teaspoon yeast nutrient around 10-15 mins

No Stout About It Boil:
- 55 IBUs Super Pride First Wort (60 min boil) *(Aussie flava)*
- The usual 1/2 tablet whirlfloc and 1/2 teaspoon yeast nutrient around 10-15 mins

Mates-en was chilled to 10C, pitched with ~200 mL 34/70 from the [Pilsner](/2020/05/19/simples-krakanup-saison-pils.html) I just transferred to keg, and fermented using the [Brulosophy quick lager method](http://brulosophy.com/methods/lager-method/).

No Stout About It was chilled to 20 C, pitched with about 3 g of Stalljen kveik flakes and fermented in a 20 C chamber.

# Tasting
The No Stout About It wort had a distinctive umami flavour, even from the start of boil. And plenty of savoury roastiness, I'm thinking it'll be yumm. Nothing particularly of note with the Mates-en wort.
