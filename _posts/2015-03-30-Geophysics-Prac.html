Consider an infinite and homogeneous Earth of resistivity \(\rho\). Let
the voltage at infinity be \(U_\infty=0\), and let us apply a voltage at
the origin as in figure <a href="#fig:equipotential_1">1</a>. Ohm's law states \(V=IR\),
where \(V\) is the potential drop through the soil. In terms of the
resistivity, this means: $$V=I\frac{\rho l}{A}$$ where \(l\) is the
distance from the voltage applied, and \(A\) is the surface area current
travels through at distance \(l\). Note that here \(l=r\), the radial
distance from the origin. This equation shows that the drop in voltage
depends on the distance travelled through the Earth, i.e. equipotential
surfaces will all be equidistant from the origin. Noting that \(A\) forms
a hemisphere gives \(A=\frac{1}{2}4\pi r^2\), so:
</p>
\begin{equation}
V(\mathbf{r})=I\frac{\rho}{2\pi r} \label{eq:V_from_node}
\end{equation}

<p>
Extending this idea to incorporate two applied voltages can be
accomplished through superposition. Figure <a href="#fig:equipotential_2">2</a> shows the equipotential
surfaces and currents caused by two equal and opposite applied voltages.
The corresponding extension to \eqref{eq:V_from_node} for two
sources is:
</p>
\begin{align}
V(\mathbf{r})&=I\frac{\rho}{2\pi\left|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r_a}\right|}-I\frac{\rho}{2\pi\left|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r_b}\right|} \notag\\
V(\mathbf{r})&=I\frac{\rho}{2\pi}\left[\frac{1}{\left|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r_a}\right|}-\frac{1}{\left|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r_b}\right|}\right] \label{eq:V_from_dipole}

</div>

<p>
However, since \(V_\infty\) cannot be measured in a practical test, two
separate voltage measurements must be made and the difference used in
order to gain meaningful results. Such a measurement can be made with
the experimental setup shown in figure <a href="#fig:wenner">3</a>. Using
\eqref{eq:V_from_dipole} and assuming that current is injected from node
\(A\) to node \(B\), the voltage between nodes \(M\) and \(N\) is given by:
</p>
\begin{align}
V_{MN}=V(M)-V(N)&=I\frac{\rho}{2\pi}\left[\frac{1}{\left|\mathbf{r_m}-\mathbf{r_a}\right|}-\frac{1}{\left|\mathbf{r_m}-\mathbf{r_b}\right|}-\frac{1}{\left|\mathbf{r_n}-\mathbf{r_a}\right|}+\frac{1}{\left|\mathbf{r_n}-\mathbf{r_b}\right|}\right] \label{eq:geom_K}\\
&=I\frac{\rho}{2\pi}\frac{1}{K} \label{eq:V_homo}
\end{align}
<p>
where \(K\) is known as the geometric factor, dependent on the electrode
setup.
</p>

<p>
Where the Earth in no longer homogeneous, \(\rho\) may be constantly
varying, thus a given electrode setup can only measure a weighted
indication of the local resistivity. Therefore, once a heterogeneous
Earth is considered, we refer to the measured resistivity as the
apparent resistivity, \(\rho_a\) [<a href="#wightman2004application">4</a>].
Rearranging \eqref{eq:V_homo}

\begin{equation}
\rho_a=2\pi K \frac{V}{I} \label{eq:apparent_resistivity}

<p>
A dipole-dipole array uses separated dipoles for each pair, the
current injectors and the voltage measuring. This setup is depicted in
figures <a href="#fig:dipole_1">4</a> and <a href="#fig:dipole_2">5</a>. Let the left and right current
nodes be nodes \(b\) and \(a\) respectively, and the left and right
voltage nodes be \(m\) and \(n\) respectively. It can be seen that:
</p>

\begin{align}
\left|\mathbf{r_m}-\mathbf{r_b}\right|&=(n+1)\alpha, & \left|\mathbf{r_n}-\mathbf{r_b}\right|&=(n+2)\alpha, \\ \left|\mathbf{r_m}-\mathbf{r_a}\right|&=n\alpha, & \left|\mathbf{r_n}-\mathbf{r_a}\right|&=(n+1)\alpha
\end{align}

<p>
Using the geometric factor definition from \eqref{eq:geom_K}, the geometric
factor is given by:
</p>
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{K}&=\left[\frac{1}{n\alpha}-\frac{1}{(n+1)\alpha}-\frac{1}{(n+1)\alpha}+\frac{1}{(n+2)\alpha}\right] \notag\\
\frac{1}{K}&=\left[\frac{1}{n\alpha}-\frac{2}{(n+1)\alpha}+\frac{1}{(n+2)\alpha}\right] \notag\\
\frac{1}{K}&=\frac{(n+1)(n+2)\alpha^2 - 2n(n+2)\alpha^2 + n(n+1)\alpha^2}{n(n+1)(n+2)\alpha^3} \notag\\
\frac{1}{K}&=\frac{1}{\alpha}\frac{2}{n(n+1)(n+2)} \notag\\
K&=\frac{1}{2}\alpha n(n+1)(n+2) \label{eq:K}
\end{align}
<p>
Combining \eqref{eq:apparent_resistivity} and \eqref{eq:K} gives the
following [<a href="#wightman2004application">4</a>]:
</p>
\begin{equation}
\rho_a=\pi\alpha
n(n+1)(n+2)\frac{V}{I} \label{eq:dipole}

<p>
Figure <a href="#fig:dipole_depth">6</a> demonstrates how using \eqref{eq:dipole}, and
varying \(n\) allows a two-dimensional depth-resistivity profile to be
produced. Since most soils have a relatively high resistivity, with
the exception of metal ore deposits, most of the resistivity actually
measured is due to the pore water content of the soil

Each group's GPS coordinates were plotted in order to compare the

figure <a href="#fig:GPS">11</a>. However, the locations for group 1 were seen to be
inaccurate, showing a location approximately 1 km north of the actual
location. Therefore, sketched information from figure <a href="#fig:sketch">8</a> was
used for the group 1 location. An updated map is given in figure
<a href="#fig:GPS_est">12</a>.

<p>
The information in figures <a href="#fig:1-res">9</a> and <a href="#fig:2-res">10</a> both agreed with
one-another and agreed with observations made at the site. It should
be noted that the left side of the plots corresponded to the
southern-most measurements. Both plots indicated a high surface
resistance on the southern end of the line. Additionally, results in
figure <a href="#fig:1-res">9</a> <i>Bottom)</i> displayed a longer section of high surface
resistance compared with those in figure <a href="#fig:1-res">9</a> <i>Bottom)</i>. This was
consistent with the fact that group 1's cable ran further south. This
was also consistent with observations that the more southern stakes
were harder to insert. Harder and rockier soil is generally drier and
less conductive, as it holds less pore water.
</p>

<p>
Both figures <a href="#fig:1-res">9</a> and <a href="#fig:2-res">10</a> showed two areas of lower
resistivity at a depth of approximately 8&#x2013;10 m. These sections also
appeared to line up between the two results. This is better
demonstrated in figure <a href="#fig:res_aligned">13</a>, where the results were scaled
such that the group 1 size to group 2 size ratio was
2.5:3. Additionally, the two have been positioned such that group 1
node 28 aligns with group 2 node 24, as noted by the practical
supervisor.

</div>

<p>
Results in figure <a href="#fig:res_aligned">13</a> supported one another, indicating
accuracy in the measurements. Many of the common features physically
aligned between the two images in figure <a href="#fig:res_aligned">13</a>, including:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>three regions of lower resistivity at approximately 8&#x2013;10 m depth,
although the south-most region was more apparent in group 1's
results;
</li>
<li>a region of higher resistivity between the first two lower
resistivity regions, which was again more apparent in group 1's
results; and
</li>
<li>A shallow, high resistivity region along the southern surface.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Examination of figures <a href="#fig:res_aligned">13</a> and <a href="#fig:GPS_est">12</a> indicated that
the latter mentioned region of high surface resistivity corresponded
to an area with little tree coverage. Areas with fauna coverage
however indicated a relatively high surface resistance. This was
likely no coincidence, instead indicating that the lack of tree
coverage had allowed the Sun to dry the surface in this area.
</p>

<p>
Figures <a href="#fig:res_aligned">13</a> and <a href="#fig:GPS_est">12</a> also showed that the two
dominant regions of lower resistivity lied near the mound to the west
of the measurements. It is possible that pore water in the mound
remaining from the wet season had seeped down, leaving the measured
region wetter than it would have otherwise been.  This was also the
region with the most tree coverage, which likely aided in pore water
retention.
</p>

<p>
Continued examination of <a href="#fig:res_aligned">13</a> showed the southern surface
region of group 1's results displayed an odd pattern not seen in group
2's results, where underneath node 2 there was a low resistivity
region.  It is possible that this was indicative of a bad
measurement. This may have also affected deeper regions, since an
iterative estimation is used to correct for heterogeneities in the
soil. This was supported by the two exaggerated regions of very high
and very low resistivity measured deeper below this area in group 1
results. Therefore it is likely that the southern measurements of
group 2 were more accurate than the southern measurements of group 1,
and that these regions were not in actuality so exaggerated. It is
possible these inconsistencies in group 1's measurements were due to
the change in current from 100 mA to 150 mA halfway through the test.

<h2 id="sec-7"><span class="section-number-2">7</span> Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">
<p>
The aim of the practical, to analyse a two-dimensional vertical
section of Earth and analyse the pore water content using
dipole-dipole resistivity measurements, was achieved. The results
indicated a high surface resistivity over exposed areas of earth, and
a relatively lower surface resistivity over regions shaded by
trees. The analysis also showed evidence of pore water at a depth of
approximately 8&#x2013;10 m to the east of a nearby mound. It was determined
to be likely this pore water seeped from the mound from the wet
season, and was preserved by the shade of surrounding fauna.
</p>

<p>
An interesting additional conclusion was errors in the southern
measurements of group 1's results, which propagated to show
inconsistencies along the entire southern region. These errors were
attributed to a change in supplied current halfway through the test.
