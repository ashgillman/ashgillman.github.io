The [JCU Robo Club](https://www.facebook.com/groups/JCUrobotics/) has just held
our first major event, in the form of a line-follower robot death-match. The
challenge was perfect for the club to establish our purpose of promoting
robotics as a fun hobby and teaching the skills required from the very basics.

Throughout the semester we held a number of sessions, including a build session
where students learned how to solder and another where students learned to
program Arduino boards. The club is proud to be promoting the learning of these
skills for fun rather than business. The club has been successful in making
robotics accessible, proven by the fact that both the winners and runners up
were completely new to robotics six months ago.

The robots used were
[Pololu Zumos](http://www.pololu.com/category/129/zumo-robot-and-accessories)
supplied by [Robot Gear](http://www.robotgear.com.au/). The flexibility of these
robots is such that we plan on using them for a number of upcoming projects,
including a [sumo](http://robogames.net/rules/all-sumo.php) competition in the
upcoming semester and possibly for a special real-life video game project we
have on the drawing board.
